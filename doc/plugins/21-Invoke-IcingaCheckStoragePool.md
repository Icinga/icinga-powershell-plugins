# Invoke-IcingaCheckStoragePool

## Description

Checks availability, utilization and state of a StoragePool.

Invoke-IcingaCheckStoragePool Checks the availability, utilization and state of a StoragePool. If no
StoragePool can be found on your system then an UNKNOWN check package is thrown with the corresponding error message.

## Permissions

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| ---      | ---  | ---      | ---     | ---         |
| IncludeStoragePool | Array | false | @() | With this parameter you can filter out which StoragePools you want to check, provided you have several StoragePools on your system. |
| ExcludeStoragePool | Array | false | @() | With this parameter you can filter out which StoragePools you do not want to check, provided you have several StoragePools on your system. |
| FreeSpaceWarning | Object | false |  | Used to specify a Warning threshold for the StoragePool FreeSpaces in GB. This value is a decreasing metric which will require<br /> you to add a ':' behind the threshold, like '20GB:' to check if free space is lower compared to your threshold |
| FreeSpaceCritical | Object | false |  | Used to specify a Critical threshold for the StoragePool FreeSpaces in GB. This value is a decreasing metric which will require<br /> you to add a ':' behind the threshold, like '20GB:' to check if free space is lower compared to your threshold |
| TotalUsedWarning | Object | false |  | Used to specify TotalUsed Warning threshold in GB. |
| TotalUsedCritical | Object | false |  | Used to specify TotalUsed Critical threshold in GB. |
| IsReadOnlyCritical | Object | false |  | Used to specify a Critical threshold for the StoragePool IsReadOnly Attr. |
| CapacityWarning | Object | false |  | Used to specify a Warning threshold for the StoragePool Capacity. |
| CapacityCritical | Object | false |  | Used to specify a Critical threshold for the StoragePool Capacity. |
| ClearOnDeallocateCritical | Object | false |  | Critical threshold for StoragePool ClearOnDeallocate is, if physical disks should be zeroed (cleared of all data) when<br /> unmapped or removed from the storage pool. |
| SupportsDeduplicationCritical | Object | false |  | Critical threshold StoragePool SupportsDeduplication is, whether the storage pool supports data duplication or not. |
| IsPowerProtectedCritical | Object | false |  | Critical threshold for StoragePool IsPowerProtected is, whether the disks in this pool are able to tolerate power loss without data loss.<br /> For example, they automatically flush volatile buffers to non-volatile media after external power is disconnected. |
| HealthStatusWarning | Object | false |  | Warning threshold for Health of StoragePool is whether or not the storage pool can maintain the required redundancy levels. |
| HealthStatusCritical | Object | false |  | Critical threshold for Health of StoragePool is whether or not the storage pool can maintain the required redundancy levels. |
| RetireMissingPhysicalDisksWarning | Object | false |  | Warning threshold RetireMissingPhysicalDisks specifies whether the storage subsystem will automatically retire physical disks that are missing from this<br /> storage pool and replace them with hot spares or other physical disks that are available in the storage pool. |
| RetireMissingPhysicalDisksCritical | Object | false |  | Critical threshold RetireMissingPhysicalDisks specifies whether the storage subsystem will automatically retire physical disks that are missing from this<br /> storage pool and replace them with hot spares or other physical disks that are available in the storage pool. |
| IncludePrimordial | SwitchParameter | false | False | A primordial pool, also known as the 'available storage' pool is where storage capacity is drawn and returned in the<br /> creation and deletion of concrete storage pools. Primordial pools cannot be created or deleted. You can set this to<br /> true if you also want to check Primordial StoragePools. Default to false. |
| NoPerfData | SwitchParameter | false | False | Disables the performance data output of this plugin. Default to FALSE. |
| Verbosity | Object | false | 0 | Changes the behavior of the plugin output which check states are printed:<br /> 0 (default): Only service checks/packages with state not OK will be printed<br /> 1: Only services with not OK will be printed including OK checks of affected check packages including Package config<br /> 2: Everything will be printed regardless of the check state<br /> 3: Identical to Verbose 2, but prints in addition the check package configuration e.g (All must be [OK]) |
| ThresholdInterval | String |  |  | Change the value your defined threshold checks against from the current value to a collected time threshold of the Icinga for Windows daemon, as described [here](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-for-windows/latest/doc/110-Installation/06-Collect-Metrics-over-Time/). An example for this argument would be 1m or 15m which will use the average of 1m or 15m for monitoring. |
