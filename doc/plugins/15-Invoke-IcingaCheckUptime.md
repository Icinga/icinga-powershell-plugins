# Invoke-IcingaCheckUptime

## Description

Checks how long a Windows system has been up for.

InvokeIcingaCheckUptime returns either 'OK', 'WARNING' or 'CRITICAL', based on the thresholds set.
e.g 'C:\Users\Icinga\Backup' the system has been running for 10 days, WARNING is set to 15d, CRITICAL is set to 30d. In this case the check will return OK.
