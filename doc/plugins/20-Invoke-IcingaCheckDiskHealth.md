# Invoke-IcingaCheckDiskHealth

## Description

Checks availability, state and utilization of the physical hard disk

Checks the state, accessibility and usage of a physical disk. There are a total
of 8 PerfCounter checks that represent the usage of a physical disk, and each of
them has its own threshold value, i.e. you cannot use only one threshold value to check
how fast a disk is writing and reading.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| ---      | ---  | ---      | ---     | ---         |
| IncludeDisk | Array | false | @() | Specify the index id of disks you want to include for checks. Example 0, 1 |
| ExcludeDisk | Array | false | @() | Specify the index id of disks you want to exclude from checks. Example 0, 1 |
| IncludePartition | Array | false | @() | Specify the partition drive letters for disks to include for checks. Example C:, D: |
| ExcludePartition | Array | false | @() | Specify the partition drive letters for disks to exclude from checks. Example C:, D: |
| DiskReadSecWarning | Object | false |  | Warning threshold for disk Reads/sec is the rate of read operations on the disk. |
| DiskReadSecCritical | Object | false |  | Critical threshold for disk Reads/sec is the rate of read operations on the disk. |
| DiskWriteSecWarning | Object | false |  | Warning threshold for disk Writes/sec is the rate of write operations on the disk. |
| DiskWriteSecCritical | Object | false |  | Critical threshold for disk Writes/sec is the rate of write operations on the disk. |
| DiskQueueLenWarning | Object | false |  | Warning threshold for current Disk Queue Length is the number of requests outstanding on the disk at the time the performance data is collected.<br /> It also includes requests in service at the time of the collection. This is a instantaneous snapshot, not an average over the<br /> time interval. Multi-spindle disk devices can have multiple requests that are active at one time, but other concurrent requests<br /> are awaiting service. This counter might reflect a transitory high or low queue length, but if there is a sustained load on the<br /> disk drive, it is likely that this will be consistently high. Requests experience delays proportional to the length of this queue<br /> minus the number of spindles on the disks. For good performance, this difference should average less than two. |

| DiskQueueAvgLenWarning | Object | false |  | Warning threshold for Avg. Disk Queue Length is the average number of both read and write requests that were queued for the selected disk during the sample interval. |
| DiskQueueAvgLenCritical | Object | false |  | Critical threshold for Avg. Disk Queue Length is the average number of both read and write requests that were queued for the selected disk during the sample interval. |
| DiskReadByteSecWarning | Object | false |  | Warning threshold for disk Read Bytes/sec is the rate at which bytes are transferred from the disk during read operations. |
| DiskReadByteSecCritical | Object | false |  | Critical threshold for disk Read Bytes/sec is the rate at which bytes are transferred from the disk during read operations. |
| DiskWriteByteSecWarning | Object | false |  | Warning threshold for disk Write Bytes/sec is rate at which bytes are transferred to the disk during write operations. |
| DiskWriteByteSecCritical | Object | false |  | Critical threshold for disk Write Bytes/sec is rate at which bytes are transferred to the disk during write operations. |
| DiskAvgTransSecWarning | Object | false |  | Warning threshold for avg. Disk sec/Transfer is the time, in seconds, of the average disk transfer. If the threshold values are not in seconds, please enter a unit such as (ms, s, m, h, ...) |
| DiskAvgTransSecCritical | Object | false |  | Critical threshold for avg. Disk sec/Transfer is the time, in seconds, of the average disk transfer. If the threshold values are not in seconds, please enter a unit such as (ms, s, m, h, ...) |
| DiskAvgReadSecWarning | Object | false |  | Warning threshold for avg. Disk sec/Read is the average time, in seconds, of a read of data from the disk. If the threshold values are not in seconds, please enter a unit such as (ms, s, m, h, ...) |
| DiskAvgReadSecCritical | Object | false |  | Critical threshold for avg. Disk sec/Read is the average time, in seconds, of a read of data from the disk. If the threshold values are not in seconds, please enter a unit such as (ms, s, m, h, ...) |
| DiskAvgWriteSecWarning | Object | false |  | Warning threshold for Avg. Disk sec/Write is the average time, in seconds, of a write of data to the disk. If the threshold values are not in seconds, please enter a unit such as (ms, s, m, h, ...) |
| DiskAvgWriteSecCritical | Object | false |  | Critical threshold for Avg. Disk sec/Write is the average time, in seconds, of a write of data to the disk. If the threshold values are not in seconds, please enter a unit such as (ms, s, m, h, ...) |
| IgnoreOfflineDisks | SwitchParameter | false | False | Ignores any disk which is having the state `Offline` and returns `Ok` instead of `Warning` for this specific state |
| IgnoreReadOnlyDisks | SwitchParameter | false | False | Ignores any disk which is having the state `Read Only` and returns `Ok` instead of `Warning` for this specific state |
| CheckLogicalOnly | SwitchParameter | false | False | Set this to include only disks that have drive letters like C:, D:, ..., assigned to them. Can be combined with include/exclude filters |
| NoPerfData | SwitchParameter | false | False |  |
| Verbosity | Int32 | false | 0 | Changes the behavior of the plugin output which check states are printed:<br /> 0 (default): Only service checks/packages with state not OK will be printed<br /> 1: Only services with not OK will be printed including OK checks of affected check packages including Package config<br /> 2: Everything will be printed regardless of the check state<br /> 3: Identical to Verbose 2, but prints in addition the check package configuration e.g (All must be [OK]) |
| ThresholdInterval | String |  |  | Change the value your defined threshold checks against from the current value to a collected time threshold of the Icinga for Windows daemon, as described [here](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-for-windows/latest/doc/110-Installation/06-Collect-Metrics-over-Time/). An example for this argument would be 1m or 15m which will use the average of 1m or 15m for monitoring. |
