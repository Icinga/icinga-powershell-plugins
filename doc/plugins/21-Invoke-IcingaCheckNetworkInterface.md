# Invoke-IcingaCheckNetworkInterface

## Description

Checks availability, state and Usage of Network interfaces and Interface Teams

This plugin checks availability, status and load of a network adapter. It is also
equipped with various parameters, so you have the possibility to decide almost
everything by yourself, when the single checks have to be Warning or Critical. For the
Team-Members Physical adapters no Performance Counter are displayed.

## Permissions

| ThresholdInterval | String |  |  | Change the value your defined threshold checks against from the current value to a collected time threshold of the Icinga for Windows daemon, as described [here](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-for-windows/latest/doc/110-Installation/06-Collect-Metrics-over-Time/). An example for this argument would be 1m or 15m which will use the average of 1m or 15m for monitoring. |
