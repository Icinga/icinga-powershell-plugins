| Argument | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| ---      | ---  | ---      | ---     | ---         |
| Warning | Object | false |  | Used to specify a Warning threshold for the number of path defined.<br /> Use for example 8: for alerting for less than 8 MPIO paths available |
| Critical | Object | false |  | Used to specify a Critical threshold for the number of path defined.<br /> Use for example 6: for alerting for less than 6 MPIO paths available |
| NoPerfData | SwitchParameter | false | False | Disables the performance data output of this plugin |
| Verbosity | Object | false | 0 | Changes the behavior of the plugin output which check states are printed:<br /> 0 (default): Only service checks/packages with state not OK will be printed<br /> 1: Only services with not OK will be printed including OK checks of affected check packages including Package config<br /> 2: Everything will be printed regardless of the check state<br /> 3: Identical to Verbose 2, but prints in addition the check package configuration e.g (All must be [OK]) |
| ThresholdInterval | String |  |  | Change the value your defined threshold checks against from the current value to a collected time threshold of the Icinga for Windows daemon, as described [here](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-for-windows/latest/doc/110-Installation/06-Collect-Metrics-over-Time/). An example for this argument would be 1m or 15m which will use the average of 1m or 15m for monitoring. |
