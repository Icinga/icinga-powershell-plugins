### New Plugins

#### Invoke-IcingaCheckHTTPStatus

[#163](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-plugins/issues/163) Checks the response time, the return code and content of HTTP requests.

### Enhancements

* [#14](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-plugins/issues/14) Rework of `Invoke-IcingaCheckMemory` to use new features from 1.5.0 for % handling and added page file check content including arguments. Please have a look on the [upgrading docs](30-Upgrading-Plugins.md)
* [#71](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-plugins/pull/71) Rework `Invoke-IcingaCheckUsedPartitionSpace` to properly use Framework v1.5.0 functionality and resolve upper/lower case drive filtering
* [#156](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-plugins/issues/156) Adds feature to modify the output status of `Invoke-IcingaCheckCertificate` from `UNKNOWN` to `OK` in case no certificate was found by setting the new argument `-IgnoreEmpty`
* [#159](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-plugins/issues/159) Replaces the deprecated function `Get-EventLog` with `Get-WinEvent`. In addition, the plugin received a new argument `-MaxEntries` to allow additional filtering for the number of events fetched to improve performance in addition. The EventLog now also supports an array with list items, allowing easier filtering for severities which are allowed inside the EventLog.
* [#167](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-plugins/issues/167) Upgrades plugin configuration files to Framework version 1.5.0

### Bugfixes

* [#144](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-plugins/pull/144) Fixes filtering for `Invoke-IcingaCheckEventLog` which resulted in wrong results, depending on the plugin configuration

* [#160](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-plugins/issues/160) While filtering for certain services with `Get-IcingaServices`, there were some attributes missing from the collection. These are now added resulting in always correct output data.
* [#161](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-plugins/issues/161) Fixes a copy & paste error on `Invoke-IcingaCheckUsedPartitionSpace`, as a wrong check variable was used for forcing `Unknown` results
* [#171](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-powershell-plugins/issues/171) Fixes wrong OK states for `Invoke-IcingaCheckPerfCounter`, in case counters for categories with instances were not present
